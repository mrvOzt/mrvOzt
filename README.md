- âœ¨ Hello, I am Merve Ã–ztÃ¼rk, a third-year Computer Engineering student at Dokuz Eylul University.
- ðŸ”­ I am currently developing my skills in both front-end and back-end areas. I enjoy learning and I am interested in keeping up with new technologies.
- ðŸŒ± I am currently actively learning React and developing websites with ASP.NET CORE MVC.
- ðŸŽ® Although I have gained many skills since I started my career, there are still many areas that I need to develop alongside the advancing technologies. Thanks to my passion for learning, I am becoming more specialized in various areas every day.
- ðŸŽ¨ Whenever I have the opportunity, I also create visual designs in addition to software development.
